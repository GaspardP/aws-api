# aws-api examples

This directory contains examples of usage of aws-api. To explore,
clone this repo and start a repl in your preferred environment
using the deps.edn in the project root, e.g.

```
clj -A:dev
```

Then you can open any of the xxx_examples.clj files and start evaluating forms. In each example
namespace, forms are contained within a `comment` block to prevent their accidental side-effectful
evaluation.
